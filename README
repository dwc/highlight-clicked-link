This is a Chrome extension that approximates the behavior of most
other browsers when you click links by highlight (or focusing) the
link.

Right now it is a bit rough around the edges, but the basic dotted
border works.  Some glitches may occur due to the CSS used.  Also, it
doesn't yet highlight the link you clicked when going back a page.
